The early bird gets the worm, but the second mouse gets the cheese.
You will find a solution to your problem in the next few days.
A closed mouth catches no flies.
The best things in life are free.
Don't count your chickens before they hatch.
An apple a day keeps the doctor away.
Good things come to those who wait.
The journey is the reward.
All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.
